Networking Revision Lab – Packet Tracer
This project is a comprehensive networking revision lab that I built for myself using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The goal was to review and practice most of the topics I’ve learned during my networking journey, including both basic and advanced concepts.

Lab Overview
The lab includes:

IoT Devices

IoT sensors configured and connected

Smart devices controlled via a management dashboard

VLANs & Wireless

VLAN 10: Employee Network

VLAN 20: Guest Network

VLAN 99: Management Network

Wireless access configured for both VLANs

VoIP Configuration

VoIP phones with assigned numbers and IPs

DHCP assigned IP addresses to VoIP devices

Servers

NTP Server for time synchronization

Syslog Server for logging network events

Web Server (with DNS mapping)

DNS Server for domain name resolution

Security

ACLs (Access Control Lists) applied to secure the network

SSH Access restricted to the management VLAN only

Routing

Internal Routing: Configured on Multi-layer Switch

External Routing: Done via a router acting as the connection to the cloud

IP Addressing
Dynamic IP assignment (DHCP) is configured for all VLANs and VoIP devices.

IoT devices have static or DHCP-assigned IPs depending on the scenario.

Purpose of the Lab
This lab is meant for:

Revising practical networking concepts

Practicing real-life network design in Packet Tracer

Preparing for certifications like CCNA

Helping anyone who wants to test their skills in IoT, VLANs, VoIP, wireless, routing, and security in one environment

How to Use
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.x recommended)

Watch the video demo (linked in the repo) for a walkthrough

Modify or expand the lab based on your needs
