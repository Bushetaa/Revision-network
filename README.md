# Networking Revision Lab – Packet Tracer

A **complete networking revision lab** designed in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to practice and review core networking concepts, including IoT, VLANs, VoIP, Server Configurations, Wireless, and Security.

## 🗂️ Lab Components

### 🔧 **Network Features**

- **IoT Implementation**
  - Sensors connected and configured
  - Smart devices managed via IoT dashboard

- **VLANs & Wireless**
  - **VLAN 10** – Employee Network (with wireless access)
  - **VLAN 20** – Guest Network (with wireless access)
  - **VLAN 99** – Management Network (for SSH and administration)

- **VoIP Setup**
  - VoIP phones with IP and number assignment via DHCP

- **Server Configurations**
  - **NTP Server** – Network time synchronization
  - **Syslog Server** – Log management
  - **Web Server** – Hosted website with DNS integration
  - **DNS Server** – Domain name resolution

- **Security**
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** applied to control traffic and secure access
  - **SSH Access** limited to VLAN 99 (Management VLAN) only

- **Routing**
  - **Internal Routing:** Configured on Multi-layer Switch (Inter-VLAN Routing)
  - **External Routing:** Configured on a Router (simulating cloud connectivity)

### 🌐 **IP Addressing**

- **DHCP**: Automatic IP assignment for all VLANs and VoIP devices  
- **Static IPs**: Used where necessary for specific devices and servers  
- **IoT Sensors**: Mix of static and DHCP IPs based on use case
